# Applied Machine Learning - Tutorials

Tutorials take place in weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10.   

Although tutorials themselves do not count towards your grade, you will find that you understand the material much better, and are better prepared for the exam if you engage with the tutorial sessions.

The tutorial problem sheets will be available here, one week before the tutorials, and the answers will be available the following week. You should work through the tutorial sheet on your own or in a group before your assigned session. Then during the session you can present your results and will be able to discuss any issues you had. 

You do not need to submit your solutions.
